== Description ==

VW Handyman Services is an elegant theme with expertly crafted and professional design giving you a sophisticated website for your handyman services. Any handyman, maintenance and renovation, plumbing or gardening, carpentry, and cleaning services provider will be able to get a stunning website with this theme. The design is kept minimal to keep the focus on the important points and gives you a clean and sorted display of every service you are providing along with its details as well as pricing. Developers have made it user-friendly and packed it with retina-ready images. SEO-friendly codes have been used in the design to bring more organic traffic to your website that will ultimately fetch you more clients. With amazing banner and slider settings, you will be able to flash catchy images. There are personalization options given with the live theme customizer. Call To Action Buttons (CTA) and social media options are very well integrated into the theme for providing you with better promotion options. Mobile-friendly options provided in the theme make the website work really well on small screen devices also. The Bootstrap framework makes the design easily modifiable and CSS animations make it interactive. The .pot files make the design translation ready and support multiple languages.
